 * Render states define the necessary properties for a subject to be rendered.

 *   - Immutable (until the subject is rendered)
 *   - Thread safe
 *   - Fast to create (ideally just settings and properties, no code or anything too complex)
 * 
 * Render states may be reused and updated after the subject has completed rendering provided the conditions
 * listed above always remain true.
