        Tip: Messages like "Exit code 0" from your launcher are not what you're looking for. If your launcher does not provide a button to view the most recent crash report, check your game's "crash-reports" folder for the most recent crash report file.
        
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.
